## Background
In this project, you will implement the KNN algorithm to classify the age of abalone using the Abalone dataset provided by the UCI Machine Learning repository. KNN is a simple and yet powerful machine learning algorithm for classification tasks. This algorithm is known as an instance-based learning algorithm, because they store the training data in memory, and when a new query instance is provided, a set of similar instances are retrieved from the training data and is used to classify the new query instance. After the implementation, the algorithm should be evaluated using train-and-test split and k-fold cross validation method.
## Dataset
The Abalone dataset are attached in this project folder. The readme file in the dataset provides additional details on the dataset. Read the file before implementing your algorithm to check whether if any data pre-processing steps are needed.

To introduce the dataset briefly, there are 4,177 data observations in the dataset with 8 input attributes and 1 output variable. The input attributes are as follows:
1. Sex [Male (M), Female (F), or Infant (I)]
2. Length
3. Diameter
4. Height
5. Whole weight
6. Shucked weight
7. Viscera weight
8. Shell weight
9. Rings (output)
